CLAIRE - PLAYER PHYSICS:

3/30
Q: Player not colliding into wall with only head level block
A: grid marching at exact points of vertices might cause ray to skid across block and doesn’t register as collision

3/30
Q: Jump gets stuck in midair
A: Need to have a case where if collision mid jump, should slide down block back to ground

3/31
Discussed with Will Cai about jump logic
